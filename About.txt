This repository contains scripts used in projects I was a part of.
Due to not being part of those teams anymore, I don't feel at liberty to post the entire projects.


About "6DOFShooter"

It doesn't have a proper name since the team disbanded before reaching a release ready state.
It was made during an intership where ESNE partnered with IDC Games. The team was compossed of
university students and tutors from the IDC company. Once the intership period ended, the team 
disbanded and the game's development was halted.

It was inteded to be a 6DOF multiplayer arena space shooter with the possibilty of release at the 
IDC Games platform.


About "FreeWings"

The project is currently in development and I no longer form part of the team. My participation in
the team was in the form of an intership where I developed gameplay level elements.

The game is a realistic VR hand glider simulator with a custom setup using VR controllers as tracking 
devices for the position and orientation of the player. The intent is for the player to hang in a
contraption that would simulate piloting a real hand glider. The VR controllers would be used 
temporarily as the way to track the movement of the player inside the contraption until a proper 
tracking device was developed and integrated into the contraption.

Since this was a larger project with many dependencies, I included the headers, but leaving out 
art assets and any in-engine file. You will be to identify my section by the notes at the top of each
header.
